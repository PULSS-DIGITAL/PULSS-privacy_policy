    <h1>PULSS: PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 21 January 2026</p>

    <p>
1. Introduction
At Pulss ("we," "us," or "our"), our mission is to provide peace of mind through non-intrusive daily check-ins. To provide this life-safety service, we must collect and process personal and sensitive information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with transparency and security.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Pulss mobile application (the "App") and our Managed Response services.

2. Information We Collect
To function as a safety utility and "Vigilant Friend," we collect the following categories of data:
2.1 Personal Identification Information
●	Identity Data: Full name, date of birth (vital for paramedics to identify you).
●	Contact Data: Mobile phone number, email address, and home address.
●	Visual Data: A profile photograph (used by physical responders to identify you).
2.2 Sensitive & Operational Data (Premium / Managed Service)
●	Location Data: Real-time GPS location is collected when you check in or when a distress alert is triggered.
●	Health & Medical Data: Information you voluntarily provide regarding medical conditions, allergies, medications, and disability status.
●	Access Data: Key Safe codes, gate codes, or building entry instructions.
●	Safety Hazards: Information regarding pets (e.g., dogs) or hazards at your property to protect our responders.
2.3 Next of Kin / Emergency Contact Data
●	Names and phone numbers of the friends or family members you designate as contacts.
●	Note: By providing this data, you confirm that you have obtained the necessary consent from these individuals to share their contact details with us.
2.4 Technical Data
●	Device information (model, OS version), battery level, and network signal status (to help us distinguish between a distress event and a dead battery).
3. How We Use Your Information
We use your data strictly to facilitate your safety and the operation of the Service:
●	To verify your status: Processing your daily "Check-in" tap.
●	To trigger alerts: Notifying your Next of Kin if you fail to check in (Level 1).
●	To manage emergencies: initiating the Automated Verification Call (Level 2).
●	To dispatch assistance (Managed Service): Providing your address and access codes to Local Response Partners during a Level 3 Event.
●	To assist Emergency Services: Sharing your Medical Snapshot with Paramedics or Police if you are found unresponsive.
4. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR/UK Data Protection Act)
We process your personal data under the following legal bases:
●	Performance of Contract: To deliver the specific features of your subscription tier.
●	Vital Interests: To protect your life or physical integrity in an emergency situation.
●	Explicit Consent: We require your explicit consent to process Special Category Data (Medical Health Data) and biometric data. You may withdraw this consent at any time, but doing so will limit the effectiveness of the Managed Service.
5. Sharing Your Information
We do not sell your data. We share your information only in the following critical scenarios:
5.1 Local Response Partners (Level 3 Only)
If you subscribe to the Premium Managed Service, we share your Name, Address, Photo, and Access Codes with our contracted security or care response partners only when a Level 3 Dispatch is triggered.
5.2 Emergency Services
We may share your location, medical data, and access codes with Police, Fire, or Ambulance services if we believe there is an imminent threat to life or safety.
5.3 Third-Party Service Providers
We use trusted third parties to run our infrastructure (e.g., Cloud Hosting, SMS/Telephony providers like Twilio, and Payment Processors). These parties are bound by strict data confidentiality agreements.
6. Data Retention
●	General Account Data: Retained as long as your account is active.
●	Incident Logs: Records of Level 2 and Level 3 events (including voice recordings of automated calls) are retained for [7 years] for legal liability and audit purposes.
●	Deletion: Upon closing your account, non-essential data is deleted immediately. Incident logs may be archived securely for the statutory limitation period.
7. Security of Your Data
We employ industry-standard security measures, including:
●	Encryption: All data is encrypted in transit (SSL/TLS) and at rest (AES-256).
●	Access Control: Access to Key Safe codes and Medical Data is restricted. In our Command Centre, agents can only view this data when a specific "Red Alert" ticket is active.
8. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you have the right to:
●	Access: Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
●	Rectification: Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
●	Erasure: Request deletion of your data (subject to our legal retention obligations).
●	Restriction: Request that we restrict the processing of your data.

To exercise these rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@pulss.click.

9. Children's Privacy
While Pulss can be used by parents to monitor children, the App is not intended for direct use by children under the age of 13 without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 without verified parental consent.
10. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes via an in-app notification or email.
